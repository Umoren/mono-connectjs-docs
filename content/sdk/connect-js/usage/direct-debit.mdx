title: 'Direct Debit'

Mono Connect allows you to process one-time and recurring payments directly from connected bank accounts. This guide shows you how to implement direct debit payments.

## Payment Types

Mono Connect supports two types of direct debit:
- One-time debit: Single payment transactions
- Recurring debit: Repeating payment schedules

## Basic Implementation

To initiate a direct debit payment, configure Connect with the payments scope:

```javascript
import Connect from '@mono.co/connect.js'

const connect = new Connect({
  key: "PUBLIC_KEY",
  scope: "payments",
  data: {
    type: "one-time-debit", // or "recurring-debit"
    amount: 150000, // amount in kobo
    description: "Payment for light bill"
  },
  onSuccess: (chargeObject) => console.log(`Payment successful`, chargeObject)
})

connect.setup()
connect.open()
```

## Configuration Options

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `scope` | string | Must be set to "payments" |
| `data.type` | string | "one-time-debit" or "recurring-debit" |
| `data.amount` | number | Amount in kobo (e.g., 150000 for â‚¦1,500) |
| `data.description` | string | Description of the payment |

## Handling Success

The `onSuccess` callback receives a charge object containing payment details:

```javascript
const connect = new Connect({
  key: "PUBLIC_KEY",
  scope: "payments",
  data: {
    type: "one-time-debit",
    amount: 150000,
    description: "Payment for light bill"
  },
  onSuccess: (chargeObject) => {
    // Handle successful payment
    console.log(chargeObject)
    // Contains amount, transaction_reference, type, etc.
  }
})
```

## Example: One-time Payment

```javascript
const connect = new Connect({
  key: "PUBLIC_KEY",
  scope: "payments",
  data: {
    type: "one-time-debit",
    amount: 150000,
    description: "Payment for light bill"
  },
  onSuccess: (chargeObject) => console.log(`Payment successful`, chargeObject),
  onClose: () => console.log('Widget closed'),
  onLoad: () => console.log('Widget loaded successfully')
})

connect.setup()
```

## Example: Recurring Payment

```javascript
const connect = new Connect({
  key: "PUBLIC_KEY",
  scope: "payments",
  data: {
    type: "recurring-debit",
    amount: 150000,
    description: "Monthly subscription"
  },
  onSuccess: (chargeObject) => console.log(`Payment successful`, chargeObject)
})

connect.setup()
```

## Payment Events

Monitor the payment process using the `onEvent` callback:

```javascript
const connect = new Connect({
  key: "PUBLIC_KEY",
  scope: "payments",
  data: {
    type: "one-time-debit",
    amount: 150000,
    description: "Payment for light bill"
  },
  onEvent: (eventName, data) => {
    if (eventName === "OPENED") {
      console.log("Payment widget opened")
    } else if (eventName === "SUCCESS") {
      console.log("Payment successful")
    }
  }
})
```

<Note>
When using direct debit, the `onSuccess` callback receives a charge object instead of the auth code returned during account linking.
