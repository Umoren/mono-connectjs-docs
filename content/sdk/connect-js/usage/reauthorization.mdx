title: 'Reauthorization'
---


Reauthorization allows you to reconnect to an already authenticated account when additional verification is required. This is commonly needed when:
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is required
- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) has been set up by the user
- Additional security verification is needed
- Previous connection has expired

## Implementation

Instead of using the regular `setup()` method, reauthorization uses the `reauthorise()` method:

```javascript
const connect = new Connect({
  key: "PUBLIC_KEY",
  onSuccess: ({ code }) => console.log(`Reauth successful: ${code}`)
})

// Pass the reauth token for the account
connect.reauthorise("auth_token_here")
```

<Note>
  The `reauthorise()` method and `setup()` method should not be used together. When both are called, the last called method takes precedence.
</Note>

## Complete Example

```javascript
import connect from '@mono.co/connect.js'

const connect = new Connect({
  key: "PUBLIC_KEY",
  onClose: () => console.log('Widget closed'),
  onLoad: () => console.log('Widget loaded successfully'),
  onSuccess: ({ code }) => console.log(`Reauth successful: ${code}`)
})

function ReauthorizeButton() {
  const reauth_token = "auth_vb6klH234ox"  // Get this from your backend
  
  const handleReauthorization = () => {
    connect.reauthorise(reauth_token)
    connect.open()
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleReauthorization}>
      Reauthorize Account
    </button>
  )
}
```

## Event Handling

During reauthorization, you can monitor the process using the `onEvent` callback:

```javascript
const connect = new Connect({
  key: "PUBLIC_KEY",
  onEvent: (eventName, data) => {
    switch(eventName) {
      case "SUBMIT_MFA":
        console.log("MFA submitted:", data.mfaType)
        break
      case "ERROR":
        console.log("Error during reauth:", data.errorMessage)
        break
      case "SUCCESS":
        console.log("Reauthorization successful")
        break
    }
  }
})
```

## Error Handling

If a reauthorization token is not provided, the SDK will throw an error:

```javascript
// This will throw an error
connect.reauthorise() // Error: "Re-auth token is required for reauthorisation"

// Always ensure you have a valid reauth token
if (reauthToken) {
  connect.reauthorise(reauthToken)
  connect.open()
} else {
  console.error("Missing reauth token")
}
```

## Getting a Reauth Token

To obtain a reauth token:

1. Your backend should receive the initial auth code from successful account linking
2. Exchange this for an account ID using Mono's API
3. When reauthorization is needed, use the account ID to generate a reauth token
4. Pass this token to your frontend for use with `reauthorise()`

<Note>
  Check Mono's [API documentation](https://docs.mono.co/reference/intro#reauth-code) for details on obtaining reauth tokens.

## Best Practices

1. **Token Management**
   - Store reauth tokens securely
   - Generate new tokens only when needed
   - Don't reuse old tokens

2. **Error Handling**
   - Always handle potential errors during reauthorization
   - Provide clear feedback to users
   - Have a fallback for failed reauthorization attempts

3. **User Experience**
   - Clearly communicate why reauthorization is needed
   - Guide users through the process
   - Handle success and failure states appropriately
