# Quickstart Guide

This guide will help you integrate Mono Connect.js into your application. By the end, you'll be able to connect user bank accounts and handle authentication flows.

## Requirements

- Node.js 10 or higher
- A Mono account with API credentials
- Your Mono public key from the [dashboard](https://app.withmono.com/apps)

## Installation

Install the package using npm or yarn:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install @mono.co/connect.js

# Using yarn
yarn add @mono.co/connect.js
```

## Basic Integration

### 1. Import and Initialize

```javascript
import Connect from '@mono.co/connect.js'

const connect = new Connect({
  key: "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY", 
  onClose: () => console.log('Widget closed'),
  onLoad: () => console.log('Widget loaded successfully'),
  onSuccess: ({ code }) => console.log(`Linked successfully: ${code}`)
})

// Initialize the Connect Widget
connect.setup()
```

### 2. Create a Connect Button

```javascript
// Add a button to trigger the widget
<button onClick={() => connect.open()}>
  Link your account with Mono
</button>
```

## Configuration Options

### Required Parameters

- `key`: Your Mono public API key
- `onSuccess`: Callback function when account is successfully linked

```javascript
{
  key: "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY",
  onSuccess: ({ code }) => {
    // Handle successful connection
    console.log("Auth code:", code)
  }
}
```

### Optional Parameters

- `onClose`: Called when widget is closed
- `onLoad`: Called when widget is loaded
- `onEvent`: Called during various widget events

```javascript
{
  onClose: () => console.log("Widget closed"),
  onLoad: () => console.log("Widget loaded"),
  onEvent: (eventName, data) => {
    console.log(`Event ${eventName}:`, data)
  }
}
```

## Direct Debit Setup

For payment integration, include the payments scope and configuration:

```javascript
const connect = new Connect({
  key: "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY",
  scope: "payments",
  data: {
    type: "one-time-debit", // or "recurring-debit"
    amount: 150000, // amount in kobo
    description: "Payment for service"
  },
  onSuccess: (chargeObject) => console.log("Payment successful", chargeObject)
})
```

## Customer Data

You can pass customer information during initialization:

```javascript
const connect = new Connect({
  key: "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY",
  data: { 
    customer: {
      name: "John Doe",
      email: "john@doe.com",
      identity: {
        type: "bvn",
        number: "1234567890"
      }
    }
  },
  onSuccess: ({ code }) => console.log(`Linked successfully: ${code}`)
})
```
